## Quickstart

### Simplified Setup Process

For an effortless start with a new SpecUI application, we suggest using create-zapp-app. This tool automatically configures your setup.

To initiate a new project, execute:

```
specui new
```

During the setup, you will encounter prompts such as:

```
✔ What is the name of your project? my-app
✔ Which generator do you want to use? next
```

Once you complete these prompts, `specui` will establish a new folder named after your project and handle the installation of necessary dependencies. In the provided example, the chosen SpecUI is `next`, which is designed to install a code generator specifically for Next.js applications.

### Try It Out

To experience SpecUI firsthand, navigate into the newly created directory and run:

```
specui generate
```
