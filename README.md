⚡️ <b>Generate code</b> for:

- Any language: JavaScript, Go, Python, Ruby, Java

## Features

- **Continuous Code Generation**: Seamlessly update files when your specs or logic change.
- **Spec-Driven**: Keep everything aligned with your vision using structured, spec-based guidance.
- **Versatile**: Generate UI components, APIs, configuration files, and even entire mobile applications.
- **Framework Agnostic**: Build for React, Vue, Angular, or just Vanilla JS.

## How Does It Work?

SpecUI processes your specs using a series of Generators, Templates, and Processors to output clean, production-ready code. It's a spec-first approach that empowers you to ship faster than ever.
