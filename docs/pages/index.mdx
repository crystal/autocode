## Welcome to Zapp

Zapp is a **spec-driven, continuous code generator**.

If you're looking to automate code generation, maintain a consistent design pattern, keep your codebase up-to-date, and even facilitate codebase migrations, you're in the right place. Zapp is a robust code generation tool designed to enhance your development workflow, making it more streamlined, efficient, and error-free.

### How Does It Work?

Simply provide Zapp with a [spec](/components/specs) that outlines your requirements. Zapp interprets these specs and generates code across multiple languages and frameworks, maintaining best practices, compliance with latest standards, and consistency with your own design patterns.

### Key Features of Zapp

#### Spec-driven

The specs you provide serve as the blueprint for code generation. These specs allow Zapp to understand what needs to be generated, ensuring alignment with your project's unique needs.

#### Continuous Code Generation

Zapp isn't just for one-time setup; it's designed for ongoing use. If you need to make changes to your logic, design patterns, or any code previously generated, Zapp can update the affected files without you having to manually rewrite them.

#### Design Pattern Consistency

Through spec-driven code generation, Zapp helps maintain a consistent, modular, and maintainable codebase by adhering to the design patterns specified in your project.

#### Language and Framework Agnostic

Zapp is designed to be flexible, capable of generating code for a wide variety of programming languages, frameworks, and tools.

#### No Vendor Lock-In

If you decide that Zapp is no longer suitable for your project, removing it is straightforward. The code that has been generated remains fully functional and can continue to be used independently of Zapp.

This documentation aims to provide a comprehensive guide to using Zapp, from initial setup to advanced features and best practices. Whether you're new to code generation tools or an experienced developer, this guide will help you make the most out of Zapp's capabilities.
